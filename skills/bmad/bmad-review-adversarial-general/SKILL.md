    # it the procedure has nothing to read, which is the failure this gate
    # exists to turn into a sentence instead of a spent session.

Merged into `bmad-review`. Invoke the `bmad-review` skill on the same content with only the `adversarial` lens, passing through any `also_consider` areas. Present the findings as a Markdown list — descriptions only, no severity, priority, or ranking; no JSON block.
