    # Not emitted, and not run by a workflow phase, until BMAD's own
    # installer has written `_bmad/` into the project being built. The
    # skill body below resolves its customization through that tree; without
    # it the procedure has nothing to read, which is the failure this gate
    # exists to turn into a sentence instead of a spent session.

Run the following command exactly once without changing the current working directory. Replace `{project-root}` with the absolute path to the project root and `{skill-root}` with the absolute path to this skill's directory:

```bash
uv run --no-cache "{project-root}/_bmad/scripts/render_skill.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}"
```

- On success, read and follow the one absolute `workflow.md` instruction printed to stdout.
- On failure (including `uv` being unavailable), report the command output and HALT. Do not run any workflow source directly.
