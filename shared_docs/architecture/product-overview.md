## Product Overview

WorkPilot AI is a desktop application (+ CLI) where users describe a goal and AI agents autonomously handle planning, implementation, and QA validation. All work happens in isolated git worktrees so the main branch stays safe.

**Core workflow:** User creates a task → Spec creation pipeline assesses complexity and writes a specification → Planner agent breaks it into subtasks → Coder agent implements (can spawn parallel subagents) → QA reviewer validates → QA fixer resolves issues → User reviews and merges.

**Main features:**

- **Autonomous Tasks** — Multi-agent pipeline (planner, coder, QA) that builds features end-to-end
- **Kanban Board** — Visual task management from planning through completion with preview/emulator support
- **Agent Terminals** — Up to 12 parallel AI-powered terminals with task context injection
- **Insights** — AI chat interface for exploring and understanding your codebase
- **Roadmap** — AI-assisted feature planning with strategic roadmap generation
- **Ideation** — Discover improvements, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities
- **GitHub/GitLab Integration** — Import issues, AI-powered investigation, PR/MR review and creation
- **Azure DevOps/Jira Integration** — Import work items, sync statuses
- **Microsoft Teams Notifications** — Webhook-based notifications for task completion and PR creation
- **Changelog** — Generate release notes from completed tasks
- **Memory System** — one Obsidian vault (the shared brain) keeps what every build learns, read by every agent
- **Isolated Workspaces** — Git worktree isolation for every build; AI-powered semantic merge
- **Self-Healing** — Incident response system with CI/CD failure analysis, proactive monitoring, and production responder
- **Pixel Office** — Multi-agent coordination visualization with task queue UI
- **Learning Loop** — Analytics and learning system for continuous improvement
- **App Emulator** — Preview running applications directly in the Kanban board (human review, AI review, done columns)
- **Mobile Apps (Android & Apple)** — Build smartphone applications from the Kanban: stack detection (native Android, native iOS, Flutter, React Native/Expo, .NET MAUI, Kotlin Multiplatform, Capacitor), a device picker over the machine's real emulators and simulators, run-on-device with a captured frame, per-task platform targets, and the mobile phases and specialists of the agent chain
- **Chrome DevTools MCP** — Browser automation for coding and QA agents via Chrome DevTools Protocol
- **Pair Programming** — AI-assisted pair programming mode
- **Code Migration** — AI-guided code migration workflows
- **Design-to-Code** — Convert designs into code implementations
- **Performance Profiler** — AI-powered performance analysis and profiling
- **Documentation Agent** — Automated documentation generation and maintenance
- **Smart Estimation** — AI-based task complexity and effort estimation
- **Test Generation** — Automated test creation for existing code
- **Conflict Predictor** — AI-powered git conflict prediction
- **Arena Mode** — Compare AI model outputs side-by-side
- **MCP Marketplace** — Browse and install Model Context Protocol servers
- **Multi-Tenancy & RBAC** — In server mode, one deployment serves several isolated organizations, with fine-grained `domain.action` permissions composed into built-in and custom roles, an administration console (members, roles, organizations, invitations, audit, quotas) and a per-tenant control dashboard
- **Flexible Authentication** — Use a Claude Code subscription (OAuth) or API profiles with any Anthropic-compatible endpoint (e.g., Anthropic API, z.ai for GLM models)
- **Multi-Account Swapping** — Register multiple Claude accounts; when one hits a rate limit, WorkPilot AI automatically switches to an available account
- **Cross-Platform** — Native desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux with auto-updates
